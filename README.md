colorfad.in
===========

Color fading goodness.

I wrote [colorfad.in](http://colorfad.in) to visualize color gradients over time.

It's goal was to help designers at work get inspired. It also makes for a killer screensaver of sorts! ;)

Inpired by [uigradients](http://uigradients.com) which is written by [_ighosh](https://twitter.com/_ighosh), I decided to make this an open curated collection of color animations.

Oh and as Beyonc√© would say, "if you like it then, you should put a star on it".

Ok maybe she wouldn't say that but you get the idea :)
